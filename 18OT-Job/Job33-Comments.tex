\subsection{Job 33:26}
There are a total of seven personal pronouns in the verse, and getting them correct is essential to understand the verse:
\begin{compactenum}
    \item He - refers to the sinner
    \item he - refers to God,
    \item him - refers to the sinner, 
    \item he - refers to God,
    \item his- refers to man's face,
