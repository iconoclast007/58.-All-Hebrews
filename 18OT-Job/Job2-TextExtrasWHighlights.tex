[4] \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{And Satan answered the LORD, and said, \fcolorbox{bone}{lime}{Skin for skin}, yea, all that a man hath will he give for his life.}

\P \textcolor[cmyk]{0.99998,1,0,0}{Now when Job's three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon him, they came every one from his own place; \fcolorbox{bone}{lime}{Eliphaz} the Temanite, and \fcolorbox{bone}{lime}{Bildad} the Shuhite, and \fcolorbox{bone}{lime}{Zophar} the Naamathite: for they had made an appointment together to come to mourn with him and to comfort him.}
